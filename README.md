# Healthy Kid Final -  Imagine Cup 2016
This is the final version of the helathy kid application

• We have developed this application for imagine cup 2016

	Project Aims and Objectives
Our main aim is to help parents to identify the early childhood disorders of their child without going to the doctor, through a windows based mobile application. We will be giving various tests and suggestions to the parent to check the disorders of their child. And if the child has any illnesses, the app will notify what to do next and finally connect the doctor through our mobile and desktop application. The main objective of assessing a young child’s development is the early detection of delayed or abnormal development in order to help children achieve their maximum potential

• This is the basic idea of our product.
